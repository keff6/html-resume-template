# html-resume-template
A resume template created using html and css. Can be downloaded as a PDF.
Edit can be done only modifying the html in a static way for now. The idea is to be able to use it on a more dynamic way in the future.

### Build with:

+ HTML5
+ CSS3
+ [jsPDF](https://github.com/MrRio/jsPDF)
+ [html2canvas](http://html2canvas.hertzen.com/documentation/)
